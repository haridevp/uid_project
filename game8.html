                <h2>About The Game</h2>
                <p>You are Geralt of Rivia, mercenary monster slayer. Before you stands a war-torn, monster-infested continent you can explore at will.</p>
                <p>Your current contract? Tracking down Ciri — the Child of Prophecy, a living weapon that can alter the shape of the world.</p>
                <p>The Complete Edition contains the base game, offering a huge, over 100-hour long, open-world adventure, as well as both of its massive story expansions: Hearts of Stone & Blood and Wine worth an extra 50 hours of gameplay!</p>
                <p>It also comes with all additional content released for the game, alongside new features and items, including a built-in Photo Mode, swords, armor, and alternate outfits inspired by The Witcher Netflix series — and more!</p>
                <p>Trained from early childhood and mutated to gain superhuman skills, strength, and reflexes, witchers are a counterbalance to the monster-infested world in which they live.</p>
                <p>Gruesomely destroy foes as a professional monster hunter armed with a range of upgradeable weapons, mutating potions, and combat magic.</p>
                <p>Hunt down a wide variety of exotic monsters, from savage beasts prowling mountain passes to cunning supernatural predators lurking in the shadowy back alleys of densely populated cities.</p>
                <p> Invest your rewards to upgrade your weaponry and buy custom armor, or spend them on horse races, card games, fist fighting, and other pleasures life brings.</p>
                <p>Built for endless adventure, the massive open world of The Witcher sets new standards in terms of size, depth, and complexity.</p>
                <p>Traverse a fantastical open world: explore forgotten ruins, caves, and shipwrecks, trade with merchants and dwarven smiths in cities, and hunt across the open plains, mountains, and seas.</p>
                <p>Deal with treasonous generals, devious witches, and corrupt royalty to provide dark and dangerous services</p>
                <p>Make choices that go beyond good & evil, and face their far-reaching consequences.</p>
